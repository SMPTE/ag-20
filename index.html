      <p>An <dfn>Overview Document</dfn> is a non-due-process document intended for inclusion in a suite of related Engineering Documents that share a common root number. It illustrates the purpose of the document suite and how its parts relate to each other and to other Engineering Documents; in other words, it is a roadmap to the document suite. <a>Overview Document</a>s are intended to be made freely available to the general public. They are informative and should be written in a style that is accessible to the average technical professional, including those whose native language is not US English and those who are not fully conversant with the terminology, heritage and practices of the motion imaging industries.</p>
      <p>An <a>Overview Document</a> should be included with each suite of documents that share a common root number. It may reference other documents that are related to the suite. <a>Overview Document</a>s shall not be created for the purpose of defining the relationships among a series of documents that do not share a common root number. The appropriate way to address this need is to draft an Engineering Guideline.</p>
  </section>
  <!-- End of Terms and definitions -->

  <!-- Start of editable area. Add sections as needed, following the examples below. `id` attribue is required for each section (and subsection) for linking into TOC. Headers are required for labeling each section. Use `h2` element for top level, and `h3`, `h4`, etc. for nested sub sections as needed. For Annexes, add `class="annex"` to the top level section element, as example shows. Numbering is auto generated, including nesting. --> 

  <section id="sec-identification">
    <h2>Identification</h2>
    <p>An <a>Overview Document</a> shall bear the type designator OV. It shall share the root number of the multipart document suite with which it is associated and shall have the part number 0; for example, OV 2112-0. The Part 0 designation shall not be used for any Engineering Document.</p>

  </section>

  <section id="sec-normative-content">
    <h2>Normative content</h2>
    <p><a>Overview Document</a>s are non-normative and shall be clearly labeled as such. <a>Overview Document</a>s are permitted to include quotations from Engineering Documents that contain normative provisions. Clarity is the paramount goal of an <a>Overview Document</a>; this overrides the concerns about use of compliance terminology that apply to Engineering Documents.</p>

  </section>

  <section id="sec-preparation-and-maintenance">
    <h2>Preparation and maintenance</h2>
    <p><a>Overview Document</a>s should be prepared by the editors of multipart engineering documents in cooperation with the responsible Technology Committee and subgroups. They shall be maintained by the Technology Committee Chair(s) and the editor(s) of the <a>Overview Document</a>.</p>
    <p>An <a>Overview Document</a> should not contain forward-looking statements in regard to documents that are not ready for publication. When new Parts are added to a multipart set, or if any of the Parts of the set are revised, the <a>Overview Document</a> shall be revised at the same time.</p>

  </section>

  <section id="sec-approval">
    <h2>Approval</h2>
    <p><a>Overview Document</a>s shall be approved by the chair of the Technology Committee and the chairs of the subgroup(s) involved in their preparation and maintenance. They shall not require formal action by the TC or the Standards Committee.</p>

  </section>

  <section id="sec-withdrawl">
    <h2>Withdrawal</h2>
    <p><a>Overview Document</a>s shall not be withdrawn unless and until all Engineering documents in the suite are
withdrawn. Withdrawal shall follow the same process as approval.</p>

  </section>

  <section id="sec-structure">
    <h2>Structure</h2>
    <p>As a general guideline, <a>Overview Document</a>s should use the following structure: </p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>an overview of the general application of the related engineering documents, in a language that can be understood by non-experts</li>
      <li>an overview of the scope of various related documents, with graphical representations, if appropriate</li>
      <li> an overview of the contextual relationships of various engineering documents in a single multipart document family (using a single document root number).</li>
    </ol>
    <p><a>Overview Document</a>s should follow the style of Engineering Documents, but may vary from the formal style if
this will enhance clarity.</p>
